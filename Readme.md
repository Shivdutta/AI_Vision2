Convolution: The scanning of input image mutiple times by filter/kernal to get the features from image. 

Filters/Kernels: This helps to extracts features from input image by sliding over the image. The size of kernal is always 
smaller than size of imaage and clculated using dot prod.

Epochs: This is number of time dataset is visited to be passed to network.

1x1 Convolution: The scanning/convolution of input image with 1 by 1 filter  -- TO DO

3x3 Convolution: To DO

Feature Maps: This is collection features obtained obtained during convolution(sliding the filter/kernel over the image).

Activation Function: The funtion  which breaks the linearity to obtain desired(O/P) feature .

Receptive Field: The current scanning/convolved area of the input layer contributing to one pixel of the next layer. Local receptive field is the size of the kernel where Global is entire eimage.
